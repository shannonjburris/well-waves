  ## Description
  This is a full-stack React application that serves as an interactive sound therapy tool for both patient and provider use in music therapy practices.  More now than ever, stressors, toxins and negative environmental influences are impacting humans’ quality of life. In order to combat this and provide vibrational frequencies that promote health and wellness, we created an application that is designed to help people heal through sound.  The application is a full MERN stack application, using MongDB, Apollo Express Server, React, & Node.js.
